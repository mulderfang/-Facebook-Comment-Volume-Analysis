# Facebook Comment Volume Analysis

### Goal
分析Facebook 貼文資料集，目的希望能建立預測留言數量的模型，並且用於評估貼文成效好壞。
### Demo 
```R
Rscript model_rf.R --data data.csv
```

* Input format:.csv
* Data preprocessing:
  * Feture Selection
  * Feature Classification

### code

* method: Random Forests
* How do your perform evaluation? >>Cross-validation

### results

* Which metric do you use : Accuracy only (Since our data is balanced among different categories)
* Our improvement is not significant but with more applicability. 
* What is the challenge part of your project?
  * The original data is messy and exists lots of missing value, and our target variable(comments) is widely distributed
  * It's not that difficult to build a model to predict any variables in our dataset, but we think to make the conclusion applicable is the point.
